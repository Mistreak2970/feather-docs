Once you have clicked "Add" you show now see a Modal Form containing 5 fields.

* Display: What displays on the rank
* Tag: The tag to get the rank
* Bracket Color: The color of the rank's brackets
* Chat Color: The color of the chat of people who have the rank
* Name Color: The color of the name of people who have the rank

Configure these to your liking, and to get the rank do:

```
/tag @s add <tag>
```
