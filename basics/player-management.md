# Player Management

Player Management is the new moderation in Feather Essentials. It is much better than the old uis.

Open the Player Management menu by going to Moderation and then clicking "Player Management"

When you open the interface, you should see a button labeled "Search". You should click that.

Now, enter into the text box roughly a player's name, or don't put anything to show all players (NOT RECOMMENDED: THIS CAN CAUSE LAG DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF PLAYERS THAT HAVE JOINED YOUR SERVER.)

When you click a player, it should show their name and general info about their last location and tags.

You can execute moderation actions under this information.
